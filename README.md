This repository contains a **multi-language lexical analyzer** built using **Flex** (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) and **Python**. It allows users to analyze source code written in **C**, **Java**, and **Python**, generating lexical tokens as output.

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

The lexical analyzer system provides an interface to tokenize and analyze programming language source code. Users can input code manually or from a file, select the target language, and receive a structured output of tokens such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

## **ðŸ›  Features**

- âœ… Supports C, Java, and Python code
- âœ… Uses Flex-generated lexer executables
- âœ… Python-based controller interface (`lex_analyzer.py`)
- âœ… Accepts manual or file-based source code input
- âœ… Outputs readable tokenized results to `output.txt`
- âœ… Handles errors like missing files, invalid input, and invalid tokens

## **ðŸŽ“ Academic Note**

This project was developed as part of the course requirements for **Programming Languages** at Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges. It demonstrates practical applications of lexical analysis, tokenization, and system integration using Flex and Python.
